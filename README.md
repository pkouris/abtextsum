    abstract = "This work proposes a novel framework for enhancing abstractive text summarization based on the combination of deep learning techniques along with semantic data transformations. Initially, a theoretical model for semantic-based text generalization is introduced and used in conjunction with a deep encoder-decoder architecture in order to produce a summary in generalized form. Subsequently, a methodology is proposed which transforms the aforementioned generalized summary into human-readable form, retaining at the same time important informational aspects of the original text and addressing the problem of out-of-vocabulary or rare words. The overall approach is evaluated on two popular datasets with encouraging results.",<br/>
